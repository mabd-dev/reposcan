# v1.3.0 - Interactive Mode UI

We've introduced a beautiful terminal UI powered by [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)! Navigate through your repositories with an intuitive, keyboard-driven interface.

**Features:**
- Clean table view of all your repositories
- Real-time filtering and search
- Detailed repository information panel
- Responsive design that adapts to your terminal size

#### Breaking Changes
We changed how to define `Output` and `JsonOutputPath` in `config.toml`

old
```toml
# ...
Output = "table"
JsonOutputPath = "/somewhere/nice"
# ..
```


new
```toml
# ...
[output]
type = "table"
jsonPath = "/somewhere/nice"
# ..


check [sample/config.toml](sample/config.toml) for detailed configuration with examples
